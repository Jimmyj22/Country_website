            <span> Nicaragua is an amazing place you can travel to in many different ways. You can drive, boat, and fly to Nicaragua. If you are in Europe there are no direct flights from Europe so you would have to travel to USA, Mexico, or Panama. From New York to Nicaragua it would take a 7 hour flight that’s including a stopover Miami. If you are getting to Nicaragua by boat there are five international ports you have to look out for. Nicaragua is a very tropical country it has a lot of lakes and volcanoes. The Masaya volcano national park is an incredible sight to see. In Nicaragua you can also go Volcano boarding similar to snowboarding but instead you are going down the side of a Volcano. You can also visit the Corn Islands which are located off the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. The Corn Islands are a must see sight because of their crystal clear water that allow you to see the aquatic life. In Nicaragua they eat a lot of different foods but their meals mostly consist of rice, beans, and meat. A national dish from Nicaragua is called Gallo pinto it’s basically just rice and beans, Nicaraguans would eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This is because Gallo Pinto is very veritaile in the morning they would eat it with some eggs for dinner they would eat it with steak.

              The point of this is to show you why you should visit Nicaragua because of it’s amazing and beautiful sites to see.You would also get to do things you never done before like volcano boarding or swimming in crystal clear water where you can see the tropical fish.Also the food is amazing when you are in Nicaragua you would always feel full because of how filling the food is.
